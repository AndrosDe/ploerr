<h2 class="logo-font"> Welcome </h2>

<h4>
    This is the business website for the company ùîìùî©√∂ùîØùîØ GmbH, where the company will more than showcase its products with great detail.
    It will provide extensive information on the business, ingredients, and brewery.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, a great online shop is available to purchase the featured products, which can also be used without registering and has a quick checkout option.<br>
    Regular customers registering would be beneficial, as they would add to the order confirmation email, and also be able to revisit all completed order summaries on their profile page on this website.
    <br><br>
    ùîìùî©√∂ùîØùîØùîüùîØ√§ùî≤ wishes all of you the best and hopes that you will have a great time on our website.

## Scope
- ### Feature Ideas Planning
  When planning the App features and scope, I drew up an Importance Viability analysis of these features, please see below:

  | # | Feature | Importance | Viability |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Display all products | 5 |5 |
  | 2 | Display products details  | 5 | 5 |
  | 3 | Add products to the shopping bag | 5 | 5 |
  | 4 | Select / update quantity of a products | 5 | 5 |
  | 5 | Remove a product from the shopping bag | 5 | 5 |
  | 6 | Detailed information on the upcoming costs of the shopping bag | 5 | 5 |
  | 7 | Annymos checkout possible | 4 | 5 |
  | 8 | Register, Login and Logout to Account | 5 | 5 |
  | 9 | Email confirmation are sent | 5 | 5 |
  | 10 | User Profile with default delivery information  | 4 | 3 |
  | 11 | Order history in Profile | 4 | 5 |
  | 12 | Secure Payment of Orders | 5 | 5 |
  | 13 | Message System to show important information | 4 | 4 |
  | 14 | Saving Delivery information | 4 | 4 |
  | 15 | Changing profile settings | 4 | 5 |
  | 16 | Information on Pl√∂rr | 3 | 4 |
  | 19 | Links to Third-party Websites | 2 | 2 |
  | 20 | Create, Edit, and Delete Products | 5 | 5 |
  | 22 | Search for Products | 1 | 1 |
  | 23 | Going along with the joke | 3 | 2 |

  <br>
  Based on the results of the Feature Ideas Planning, I have decided to attempt to implement most Features, except for 22 as for the current scope of products no such feature is needed. For Stores with more products "Searching and Sorting" would be necessary.
  <br><br>

- ### Functionality Requirements
  * Clean and themed presentation of the products
  * Clean and themed presentation of the products details
  * Clean and themed presentation of the shopping bag
  * Clean and themed presentation of the checkout page
  * Clean and themed presentation of the company
  * Intuitive App navigation
  * Full CRUD functionality on products for store owners
  * Use of Defensive Programming to ensure customers can review their shopping bag before checking out
  * Robust error handling provides information

    </details>

    During the development, the profile and product pages became overcrowded with information and features.
    Therefore these pages were changed and split up into:
    - Products and Product Details
    - Profile and Profile-Settings

    Last-minute additions were:
    - the private policy page, which is a wireframe copy of the Imprint Page
    - a custom 404-Error-Page with just standard wireframe from the base with centered text in the content block
    - the confirm deletion page, which is a wireframe copy of the Product Detail Page.


  - ### Design
    [Bootstrap5  CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) was used for styling and customized for the front-end development.
    [Bootstrap4  JS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) was used for java script as the toast worked better on Bootstrap4 and was customized for the front-end development.

    - #### Typography
      I used Google Fonts to import the fonts I used across the application.

    - #### Imagery & UI
      I used a minimized home page approach and wanted the main focus of the index page to be in the background.<br>
      Which is depicting a looped video of beer being handed out to customers, giving the impression that this must beer a highly requested product.<br>
      This required a color scheme mostly of dark-background / light text, which helps to highlight any colored content on the pages and the inverted color scheme of the messages.

## Defensive Programming
To keep the application secure and the profile/profile information protected requires the user to be logged in if they want to save delivery information. Users have only access to their profile and delivery information.<br>
The user is always informed of changes via messages. A custom 404-Error Page was created.<br>
Stripe handles the payment and makes sure that the payment process is secure.<br>
Any product creation, updating, or deletion is feature restricted to the administrator. All deletions of products require a confirmation.<br><br>
To access an order-summary the  order number is required.<br>The order number is randomly created and only given to the customer of that purchase. A security breach outside this app/website (for example: customers email account was compromised, etc.) is required  to have any effect.

## SEO-Dokumentation
- ### Advertising Strategy
    As the website is about a brewery, beer, and spirits dealer there are a lot of options for commercial placements, like TV & Radio Commercials, sponsoring sports teams, banners, flyers, and so on.<br>
    However, the ùîìùî©√∂ùîØùîØ GmbH is a smaller company and therefore has to rely on more cost-efficient commercial placements.<br><br>
    The best options for that social media interactions and newsletters:<br>
    Therefore a Facebook business page has been created and is connected to the website.

    <br>
    Right next to the Facebook link on the website is the option to subscribe to a newsletter via MailChimp.

    </details>
    <br>

- ### Website Planning
  Before the website was created keywords and keyphrases were brainstormed:
  1.  A list of words associated with beer/brewery by using a [Thesaurus](https://www.thesaurus.com/):
      - beer -> ale, brew, brewage, refreshment
      - brewery -> brewhouse
  <br><br>
  2.  As the product is supposed to be "cheap" better wording was needed.<br>
    In the end, it was the consensus that the product was to be marked as:
      - inexpensive brew/ale/beer
  <br><br>
  3.  As mentioned in the [Project Goals](#project-goals):
    Pl√∂rrbr√§u <small>(-> Dishwaterbrew)</small> is based on a joke by Otto Waalkes and makes fun of beer commercials.
    The joke ùîìùî©√∂ùîØùîØùîüùîØ√§ùî≤ was presented in two variances:
      - normal ùîìùî©√∂ùîØùîØ
      - ùîìùî©√∂ùîØùîØ Lau <small>(-> half-hearted, lukewarm)</small>
    The challenge is to go along with the joke and still be a serious business website and promote the product.<br>
    Therefore normal ùîìùî©√∂ùîØùîØ will be promoted as high carbonated, sparkling and ùîìùî©√∂ùîØùîØ Lau as low carbonated, smooth brew
  <br><br>
  4.  Health and untreated products are a big concern for most customers nowadays. For that reason the products will be promoted as:
      - being naturally carbonated
      - having no exogen food additive 290
      - being made with local natural reserve water and from local ingredients
  <br><br>
  5.  To find keywords with a good volume and low competition rate [wordtraker](https://www.wordtracker.com/) was used and yielded the following additional keywords:
      - brewing company
      - craft beer near me
      - german beers
  <br><br>
  6.  This led to the creation of the final keywords list:
      - brewing company
      - beer near me
      - german beer
      - brewhouse
      - inexpensive brew/ale/beer
      - smooth brew
      - sparkling brew
      - beer from local ingredients
      - local natural reserve water
      - traditional german beer brewing
      - traditional brew
  <br><br>
- ### Implementing Keywords into Website:
  By taking inspiration from the brewing company [Pott's](https://www.potts.de/) it was decided to give visitors of the website a lot of information about the company, the ingredients, the brewing process, and the products themselves.<br>
  This way it was possible to insinuate that the products must be of high quality without stating it anywhere on the website. It does the opposite, but in a context that makes it appear to be something good.
  <br><br>
    As the index page is styled to have the [backgound as the main stage](https://usersnap.com/blog/background-webdesign/), the content has to be diverted to other pages. This led to the creation of:
  <ul>
    <li>
      quality.html
    </li>
    <li>
      brewery.html
    </li>
      This was a great opportunity to insert certain keywords into these pages as part of their content without looking out of place, like putting "beer from local ingredients", "local natural reserve water" into the quality.html, and "traditional german beer brewing" into brewery.html.<br>
      These pages add a lot of value, as a site user find out more information on the company and the product.
  </ul>
  <br>
    To give the appearance of a serious business page, the following pages were added to the footer in an extra navigation bar at the bottom of the page:
  <ul>
    <li>
      contact.html
    </li>
    <li>
      imprint.html
    </li>
    <li>
      privacypolicy.html
    </li>
    <li>
      GTC.html
    </li>
    While being mostly dry text pages, they display all needed information policywise and open the door for business-to-business deals.
    In the contact.html the keyword "beer near me" was able to be implemented into the meta description, as it does make sense content-wise.
  </ul>
  <br>
    Another great place to use the meta description was the products.html, as it allowed to insert the keyword "inexpensive ale & beer" in a kind of stealthy but still appropriate way.
  <br><br>
- ### Pictures, Videos, and external sources:
  One of the biggest successes is the index page with the video of "beer being handed out to customers" running in a loop.<br>It is supposed to subtly encourage a desire to get a beer or a drink and according to our website testers, it seems to work quite well.
  <br><br>
  The video and pictures in brewery.html also underline the professional tone of the website, helping to build trust in the company and insinuate a high-quality product.
  <br><br>
  As finding external resources for a brewing company is challenging, but the quality.html opened up a great opportunity to link to [local framers](https://www.magdochjeder.de/) and display a youtube video from them, that fits the content of the page. This is helping to make the company appear more open, friendly, and less corporate.

## Future Implementation
* offer more payment options
* update the model for products by splitting it into two connected models:
  * one for product: Pl√∂rr, Pl√∂rr Lau
  * one for the container: Single Can, Sixpack, 4x Sixpack, 10l-keg, 25l-keg, 50l-keg
* rating system for customers
* login via social media account
* securing order history to be only viewed by the customer that made the order

## Technologies Used
* Languages:
    * [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) was used for the content and structure of the site.
    * [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#CSS_3) was used for the styling of the site.
    * [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) was used for the interactivity of the site.
    * [Python](https://www.python.org/) was used for the back-end programming of the site.
<br>

* [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) 
    * was used to enable and process the payment in the checkout app

* [Amazon Web Services S3 Bucket](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1)

## Bugs, Issues, and Solutions
| # | Bugs, Errors, and Issues | Solutions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Purchase confirmation Email not sent | Removed the new updates to deal with the changes in Stripe in November 2022 to the webhook_handler.py code and went with the old code - My Stripe-API-keys were created in October 2022, which might be the reason why only the old code is accepted |
| 2 | Heroku deployment failed - backports.zoneinfo could not be built | Removed backports.zoneinfo==0.2.1 from requirments.txt |
| 3 | Toasts not working with Bootstrap 5 | Used Bootstrap 4 for the JS-toolkit and it worked perfectly
| 4 | CSS for the checkbox is not applied | No solution found so far - as the issue is so minor, it will be ignored

  1. **Select Region** and then choose a data center near you.
  1. **click** the button labeled **Review** and check your details are correct and then click **Create instance**.
  1. Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the **database instance name** for this project.
  1. In the URL section, clicking the copy icon will copy the database URL to your clipboard (best to leave this tab open, as it might be of use later)

### 2. Heroku Part 1:
  1. **Log in to Heroku** or create an account if required.
  1. **click** the button labeled **New** from the dashboard in the top right corner, just below the header.
  1. From the drop-down menu **select "Create new app"**.
  1. **Enter a unique app name**. I used the same name as the GitHub repository (ploerr) for this project.
  1. Once the web portal shows the green tick to confirm the name is original **select the relevant region.** In my case, I chose Europe as I am in Germany.
  1.  When you are happy with your choice of name and that the correct region is selected, **click** on the **"Create app" button**.

  1. Then navigate to the **settings tab** and scroll down to the **"Config Vars" section**. 
  1. **Click** the button labeled **"Reveal Config Vars"** and **enter** add the following keys and values:

      | Key | Value |
      | :---: | :---: |
      | DATABASE_URL | database url from ElephantSQL |
      | SECRET_KEY | mysecretkey |
      | USE_AWS | true |
      | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | mysecretawskey1
      | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | mysecretawskey2
      | STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | mypublicstripekey
      | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | mysecretstripekey
      | STRIPE_WH_SECRET | mywebhooksecretkey

  1. Leave this tab open for later. 
### 3. Project preparation in Gitpod:
  1. Open up your Gitpod tab
  1. To connect to an external database, install **dj_database_url** and **psycopg2** via the **terminal**.
  ```
    $  pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
  ```
  3. update the **requirements.txt** file with the newly installed packages
  ```
    $  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
  4. In the **settings.py** file, import dj_database_url **underneath the import for os**
  ```
    import os
    import dj_database_url
  ```
  5. In the **DATABASES** section update the code to connect to the new **ElephantSQL database**. Then save the settings.
  ```
    # DATABASES = {
    #     'default': {
    #         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
    #         'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    #     }
    # }
     
 DATABASES = {
     'default': dj_database_url.parse('your-database-url-here')
 }
  ```
  6. Run the **showmigrations** command in the terminal
  ```
    $  python3 manage.py showmigrations
  ```
  7. Migrate the database models to the new database
  ```
    $  python3 manage.py migrate
  ```
  8. Create a superuser for the new database
  ```
    $  python3 manage.py createsuperuser
  ```
  9. To prevent exposing the **ElephantSQL database** when pushing to GitHub, delete it again from settings.py, as it will be set up using an environment variable after the first deployment.<br>
  Reconnect to the local sqlite database.

  ```
    DATABASES = {
     'default': {
         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
         'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
     }
    }
  ```

### 4. Heroku Part 2:
  1. Scroll back to the top of the settings page, and **navigate to the "Deploy" tab.**
  1. From the deploy tab **select Github as the deployment method**.
  1. **Confirm** you want to **connect to GitHub**.
  1. **Search** for the **repository name** and **click** the **connect** button next to the intended repository.
  1. From the bottom of the deploy page **select your preferred deployment type** by following one of the below steps:  
    * Clicking either "Enable Automatic Deploys" for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github.  
    * Select the correct branch for deployment from the drop-down menu and click the "Deploy Branch" button for manual deployment.

### Local Development
* How to Fork To fork the repository, use the following steps:
Login or signup to Github and locate the repository.
Click the Fork button in the top right corner

### Making Local Clone
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrosDe/ploerr
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrosDe/ploerr

## Credits
### Code
  * This project was heavily influenced by the "Boutique Ado"-Project from Code Institute / [Chris Z.](https://github.com/ckz8780).<br>
  Especially the checkout app, stripe, and java scripts, as they were very well made and exactly what I was looking for implementing into my store part of the project.<br>
  The biggest difference is, that I prefer to use more bootstrap classes and less custom css.
